This project involved programming an FPGA to enable communication between a joystick and a PC.
Several FPGA modules were integrated into a custom wrapper to handle SPI communication with the joystick and UART communication with the PC.
The design focused on modularity and reliable real-time data transfer between the external peripheral and the host computer.
